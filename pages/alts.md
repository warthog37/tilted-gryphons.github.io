**TLDR:** If you are a core raider, you may post your alt application in the #alt-applications channel and wait for two officers to both add any reaction icon other than a red X to approve your alt. Your alt and main must be logged at the instance entrance, and you must be prepared to raid on either character as the raid composition requires, or by whim of either of the officers.

- Your alt is subject to all of the usual [raider expectations](/pages/raider-expectations/).
- Core raiders' alts are allowed to come to raid content that is one release behind the most recent raid.
- Alts may come to ZG, AQ20, and Ony regardless of content age, but you still need permission to bring your alt.
- A maximum of 5 alts may attend a raid.
- You must apply to bring your alt. Post in the #alt-applications channel to start the approval process. You must provide a wowhead link or sixtyupgrades to your current gear and spec for your review.
- First, an officer must sign off on your Main not needing anything from the raid that you want to bring your Alt to. (They will be reasonable with side-grades, etc). An officer will apply a positive reaction on your alt application post.
- Then an officer must also sign off on your Alt’s gear and spec which should be somewhat appropriate for the raid in question; 50% pre-raid items is a rough guideline but officers will have their own requirements. Jump through their hoops to get your second positive reaction on your alt application post.
- If either officer has an issue, they will react with a red X on your alt application post. Just one red X means you can’t bring your alt.
- Give your officers time to read your application, but if they take more than 36 hours or not approved by Saturday to give you any Discord reaction on your post, it's on you to actively seek them out and get permission.
- You must actively play your Alt during a raid (duh!). If you are AFK a lot, or your performance is terrible for your gear level, your alt might not be invited back.
- We will not be summoning Mains/Alts to swap out on different fights. There are exceptions to this rule such as class items from Domo's chest, items off Ragnaros, bindings, and hunter tranqs for Magmadar.
- Everyone needs to apply to bring their alt by Saturday the week before a raid.
- Your alt doesn't have to be in guild, but it is preferred.
- Sub/Casual, Friends-n-Family, and all Alt Characters are **_not eligible_** for the guild’s free enchant service.
- Alt loot priority is pretty low, review the general loot prio on the [loot](/pages/loot/) page.
