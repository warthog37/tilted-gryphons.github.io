### Loot System
We use a **loot council** which is comprised of the officers/class leads, and two randomly selected raid members each week. These raid members are temporarily promoted to Flightmaster so that they can participate in the loot council via the in-game guild officer chat channel.<br />
CLs usually have a firm idea of who is currently most eligible for an item based on attendance, attitude, performance, and effort.

### Guild Loot Priority
The guild's [loot priority outline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17gVCAlQK3_t0znFviccCSD6rcOJlXDODOXFTroTw0II/edit#gid=1516348409) is always available for you to review. This document lays out which classes have priority on specific pieces of gear and is determined by the officers. Classes or specs who don't have another good option, who will use a piece of gear for the longest, or who will get the most benefit over other classes, will tend to get prio.

### Loot Council Guidelines
Our loot is distributed according to our [loot priority outline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17gVCAlQK3_t0znFviccCSD6rcOJlXDODOXFTroTw0II/edit#gid=1516348409).
We aim to have a system that fairly distributes loot as quickly and efficiently as possible, while still keeping our raid goals in mind. That being said, here are the general steps we take when something drops:

[1] We figure out who most qualifies for it. For this, we immediately reference our loot priority document linked above.
[2] Amongst that group of people, we figure out who needs it, i.e. who it would be an upgrade for.
[3] At this point, we ask those people to roll for the item (69 = 101), unless one of these rules comes into play:

**Rule of Progress:** It's an item that seriously impacts our overall raid progression and needs to go to someone specific for reasons made public. This is where most 'tank funneling' happens. <br />
**Rule of Complements:** It would complement someone's loot exceptionally well, such as finishing a set bonus, or something like the leaf and sinew being kept together. <br />
**Rule of Round Robin:** One of the people in question has had success with rolls on significant upgrades that raid already. <br />
**Rule of Legendaries:** For weapons, bis-forever items, and some trinkets. These obviously require some unusual deliberation and consideration, including things like attendance, performance. <br />

#### Important Notes
• We do not show any special consideration towards officers / class leaders. <br />
• Two random raid members will sit on the Loot Council each week. We do this so that members can always see how things are done, they can question why loot is going to a particular person, and they can put in their vote of who should get something. This is not a high-pressure role - you can interact or just observe. <br />
• Crafting mats and non-essential BoE blues will always be sent to guild bank to help fund raiders' equipment, enchants, legendaries, etc. <br />

### Loot Priority by Rank
Loot priority will generally be decided by the following list. The lines higher up have higher priority, and anything listed on a line has equal priority and would result in gear being rolled on. Find out more about [alts](/pages/alts/).

**a.** Core Raider mainspec / Core Raider MS minor upgrade <br />
**b.** Core Raider offspec specific - meaning tanking gear, resist gear, tier, etc
**c.** Core Raider PvP (if you PvP) <br />
**d.** Trial Raider mainspec, Core Raider offspec, Core Raider Alt mainspec, Sub/Casual mainspec, Friends-n-Family mainspec <br />
**e.** PvP (if you PvP) for: Trial Raider, Core Raider Alt, Sub/Casual, Friends-n-Family <br />
**f.** Offspec for: Trial Raider, Core Raider Alt, Sub/Casual, Friends-n-Family <br />
